# Sailrouting — Dehler 37 CR Weather Router

A browser-only isochrone weather router for the Dehler 37 CR: plot waypoints
on a chart, pull live wind/current data, and get a VMG-optimized route with
ETA, leg-by-leg breakdown, and GPX export. There is no backend — every
computation runs client-side, and weather/current data comes straight from
the free [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) APIs.

## Project structure

```
index.html          Entry point — markup + CDN script tags (Tailwind, Leaflet, Lucide)
css/styles.css       App-specific styles (Tailwind handles utility classes at runtime)
js/
  constants.js       Polar performance table, presets, map defaults
  geo.js             Geodesic math (distance, bearing, projection, polygon tests)
  polar.js           Boat-speed interpolation over the polar table
  metocean.js         Wind/current fetch (Open-Meteo) with timeout + fallback + cache
  routing.js          Isochrone (wavefront) passage solver
  state.js             Shared app state
  ui.js                 Toast, sidebar drawer, tab switching
  mapLayers.js           Route/wavefront/ray rendering on the Leaflet map
  waypoints.js            Waypoint CRUD + list rendering
  zones.js                 Avoid-zone (hazard/shallows) CRUD + list rendering
  presets.js                Sample voyage presets
  results.js                 Leg table, HUD, route summary rendering
  polarChart.js               Polar diagram canvas drawing
  voyage.js                    Timeline scrubber / playback
  gpx.js                        GPX export
  optimizer.js                  Orchestrates a full route optimization run
  main.js                        Entry point: map init + event wiring
```

Everything is loaded as native ES modules (`<script type="module">`), so
there is **no build step** — open `index.html` directly, or serve the
folder with any static file server.

## Running locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

(Native ES modules require a real HTTP origin — opening `index.html` via
`file://` will fail with CORS errors on the module imports.)

## Deployment (GitHub Pages, no backend)

This repo ships a GitHub Actions workflow at
`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` that publishes the site on every push
to `main` using GitHub's official Pages actions
(`actions/configure-pages`, `actions/upload-pages-artifact`,
`actions/deploy-pages`) — no build step, it just deploys the static files.

**One-time setup required in the GitHub UI** (Actions cannot do this for
you):

1. Go to the repository's **Settings → Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment → Source**, select **GitHub Actions**.
3. Push to `main` (or re-run the "Deploy static site to GitHub Pages"
   workflow from the **Actions** tab). The site will be published at
   `https://<org-or-user>.github.io/<repo>/`.

After that first setup, every merge to `main` redeploys automatically.

## Notes on production readiness

- Tailwind is loaded via its CDN script (JIT-compiled in the browser).
  This keeps the project buildless, which fits a static, no-backend
  GitHub Pages deployment; if a stricter production setup is ever wanted,
  swap it for a compiled Tailwind CSS file via the Tailwind CLI.
- Weather/current requests use an `AbortController` timeout and fall back
  to sane defaults if the API is slow or unavailable, so the router never
  hangs waiting on a third-party service.
- Dynamic UI (waypoint list, hazard list, leg table) is built with
  `createElement`/`textContent` rather than `innerHTML` string
  interpolation, avoiding injection risk from any future user-editable
  text fields.
